# Factorial_Trailing_Zeroes


Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Follow up: Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time complexity?

 

Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.

Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
